# v3.1.0 BaisycCoin Mandatory Network Upgrade Guide

## Linux VPS

If you've used CryptoNeverSleeps BaisycCoin Linux Installation script, he has provided an easy to use upgrade guide [here](UPDATE-SCRIPT.md)

### Connect to your Linux VPS over SSH

  * Use your favorite terminal application on Linux or Putty/Bitvise clients on Windows
  * Connect to a terminal session with the Linux VPS

### Stop the BaisycCoin Linux Daemon

  * Change directory to the location you downloaded and unpacked baisyccoind and baisyccoin-cli
  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  ./baisyccoin-cli stop
  ```

### Remove the old BaisycCoin Linux Daemon

  * From the terminal session, run the following commands
  ```
  sudo rm baisyccoind
  sudo rm baisyccoin-cli
  sudo rm baisyccoin-qt
  ```

### Download, Install, and Run the v3.1.0 BaisycCoin Linux Daemon Release

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  wget https://github.com/BaisycCoin/BaisycCoin/releases/download/v1.0.0/baisyccoin-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
  ```

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  tar -zxvf baisyccoin-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
  ```

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  cd baisyccoin-1.0.0/bin/
  ```

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  ./baisyccoind
  ```

### Check the BaisycCoin Linux Daemon 
*Now check that the daemon is in sync and display the proper version*

  * From the terminal session, run the following command
  ```
  ./baisyccoin-cli getinfo
  ```

  * Compare the "Block Height" value with the latest from the [BaisycCoin block explorer](https://explorer.baisyccoin/). When those are the same, your daemon is synchronized

  * Compare the version string displayed, if upgraded properly it will say ```"version" : 1000001```
